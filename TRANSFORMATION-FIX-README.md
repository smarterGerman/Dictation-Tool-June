## German Special Character Transformation Fix

This update addresses an issue where the German umlaut transformations (like "ae" → "ä", "a:" → "ä") work correctly in a local server but fail when the dictation tool is embedded in Teachable via an iframe.

### Issues Fixed

1. **Iframe Sandbox Restrictions**
   - Added robust error handling to work within Teachable's sandbox restrictions
   - Implemented defensive coding to prevent JavaScript errors from breaking functionality

2. **Cursor Position Management**
   - Improved handling of cursor position after text transformation
   - Added fallbacks when `setSelectionRange()` fails in restricted environments

3. **Error-Resistant Transformation**
   - Split transformation into specialized functions with individual error handling
   - Each transformation phase can fail independently without affecting others

4. **Console Access**
   - Made all console logging optional with try-catch blocks
   - Prevents issues when console access is restricted in iframe environments

### Installation Instructions

1. Make sure the new files are in place:
   - `js/modules/inputManager.js.new`
   - `js/modules/textComparison.js.new`

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install-fix.sh
   ./install-fix.sh
   ```

3. Test the application in a Teachable iframe environment

### Testing

To verify the transformation works, enter the following text in the input field:
- "Muenchen" should transform to "München"
- "scho:n" should transform to "schön"
- "gru/n" should transform to "grün"
- "strasse" should transform to "straße"

### Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any errors (if accessible)
2. Verify iframe sandbox attributes include `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`
3. Restore backups from the `backups/` directory if needed

### Reverting Changes

To revert to the original files:
```bash
cp backups/YYYYMMDD/inputManager.js.bak js/modules/inputManager.js
cp backups/YYYYMMDD/textComparison.js.bak js/modules/textComparison.js
```
(Replace YYYYMMDD with the appropriate backup date folder)
