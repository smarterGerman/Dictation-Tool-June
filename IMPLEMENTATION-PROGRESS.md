# Implementation Progress: Merging Old and New Word Matching Systems

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Implementation

#### 1.1 Review Existing Files ✓
- Identified all relevant files in both old and new systems
- Documented algorithms to be ported
- Mapped old functions to new module structure

#### 1.2 Update Text Normalization ✓
- Updated `js/modules/textComparison/textNormalizer.js`
- Implemented German special character transformations
- Added segment change tracking

#### 1.3 Update Similarity Scoring ✓
- Updated `js/modules/textComparison/similarityScoring.js`
- Implemented proven Levenshtein distance algorithm
- Added overall text similarity calculation

### Phase 2: Enhanced German Word Matching ✓

#### 2.1 Keyboard Proximity Analysis ✓
- Created `js/modules/textComparison/keyboardProximity.js` with multiple keyboard layout maps:
  - German QWERTZ layout
  - US/International QWERTY layout
  - French AZERTY layout
- Implemented multi-layout adjacency detection for international users
- Enhanced Levenshtein with proximity-based substitution costs
- Added keyboard layout auto-detection functionality

#### 2.2 Length-Based Threshold Adjustments ✓
- Implemented dynamic thresholds for words of different lengths
- Added configuration options for fine-tuning threshold adjustments
- Updated word matching to use length-appropriate similarity thresholds

#### 2.3 German Typo Pattern Detection ✓
- Added detection of common German-specific typo patterns
- Implemented bonuses for recognized patterns such as "sch/sh", umlaut variants
- Created pattern-specific adjustments to similarity scores 

#### 1.4 Update Word Matcher ✓
- Updated `js/modules/textComparison/wordMatcher.js`
- Implemented word alignment algorithms
- Added text match determination function

#### 1.5 Update Input Processor ✓
- Updated `js/modules/textComparison/inputProcessor.js`
- Integrated processing function with error highlighting
- Connected segment change notifications

### Phase 2: UI Integration

#### 2.1 Update UI Manager ✓
- Updated `js/modules/uiManager.js`
- Implemented reference-text-only display approach
- Added highlighting based on user input status

#### 2.2 Update Input Manager ✓
- Updated `js/modules/inputManager.js` 
- Integrated with updated comparison system
- Added proper segment change notification
- Fixed reference text display issues

#### 2.3 Update Results Screen ✓
- Updated `js/modules/resultsScreen.js`
- Integrated with enhanced text comparison system
- Used detailed statistics for result display

## Final Steps

### Testing

The implementation needs to be tested with the example cases from the old system:

#### Example 1: Out-of-order Typing
```
Reference text: "Es gibt viel zu tun"
User input: "zu gibt Es tun"
Expected: All words except "viel" marked as correct, "viel" as missing
```

#### Example 2: Misspelled Words
```
Reference text: "Das Wetter ist schön"
User input: "Das Weter ist schon"
Expected: "Weter" marked as misspelled, "schon" marked as misspelled
```

#### Example 3: Extra Words
```
Reference text: "Die Katze schläft"
User input: "Die kleine Katze schläft gerne"
Expected: "kleine" and "gerne" marked as extra words
```

### Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive test cases
2. Optimize performance for longer text segments
3. Add support for additional languages beyond German
4. Improve handling of punctuation and special characters

## Test Cases

Need to validate the implementation using the test cases specified in the README-MERGE-OLD-W-NEW.md file:

### Example 1: Out-of-order Typing
```
Reference text: "Es gibt viel zu tun"
User input: "zu gibt Es tun"
Expected: All words except "viel" marked as correct, "viel" as missing
```

### Example 2: Misspelled Words
```
Reference text: "Das Wetter ist schön"
User input: "Das Weter ist schon"
Expected: "Weter" marked as misspelled, "schon" marked as misspelled
```

### Example 3: Extra Words
```
Reference text: "Die Katze schläft"
User input: "Die kleine Katze schläft gerne"
Expected: "kleine" and "gerne" marked as extra words
```
