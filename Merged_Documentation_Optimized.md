## Technical Details

### German Language Support

The system provides comprehensive support for German special characters:

- **Character Transformations**:
  - `ae/a:/a/` â†’ `Ã¤`
  - `oe/o:/o/` â†’ `Ã¶`
  - `ue/u:/u/` â†’ `Ã¼`
  - `s:/s/` â†’ `ÃŸ`

- **Transformation Logic**:
  ```javascript
  // Simplified example
  text = text.replace(/ae/gi, match => isUpperCase(match[0]) ? 'Ã„' : 'Ã¤');
  text = text.replace(/oe/gi, match => isUpperCase(match[0]) ? 'Ã–' : 'Ã¶');
  text = text.replace(/ue/gi, match => isUpperCase(match[0]) ? 'Ãœ' : 'Ã¼');
  text = text.replace(/a[:\/]/gi, match => isUpperCase(match[0]) ? 'Ã„' : 'Ã¤');
  // etc.
  ```

### Word Matching Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to match input words with reference text:

1. **Normalize Text** - Remove punctuation and normalize special characters
2. **Calculate Similarity Scores** - Compute similarity between each pair of words
3. **Find Best Matches** - Identify optimal alignment between reference and input words
4. **Categorize Results** - Mark words as correct, misspelled, missing, or extra

```javascript
// Process user input against reference text
const result = processInput("Es gibt viel zu tun", "zu gibt Es tun");

// Result structure:
{
  words: [
    { word: 'Es', expected: 'Es', status: 'correct', score: 1.0, position: 2 },
    { word: 'gibt', expected: 'gibt', status: 'correct', score: 1.0, position: 1 },
    { word: null, expected: 'viel', status: 'missing', score: 0, position: -1 },
    { word: 'zu', expected: 'zu', status: 'correct', score: 1.0, position: 0 },
    { word: 'tun', expected: 'tun', status: 'correct', score: 1.0, position: 3 }
  ],
  extraWords: []
}
```

### Debug Logging Strategy

The application includes a comprehensive debug logging system:

- **Thorough Event Logging** - All significant events are logged with context
- **Nested Error Handling** - Robust error handling even in restricted environments
- **Contextual Information** - All logs include relevant context for troubleshooting
- **Critical Path Validation** - Key checkpoints include validation logs

```javascript
// Example of nested try/catch for robust logging
try {
    // Main function logic
} catch (error) {
    try { 
        console.error("Descriptive error message:", error);
    } catch (e) { 
        /* Silence console errors in restricted environments */ 
    }
}
```

## Test Cases

The system has been validated with the following test cases:

### 1. Out-of-order Typing
```
Reference: "Es gibt viel zu tun"
Input: "zu gibt Es tun"
Result: Words correctly matched, "viel" marked as missing
```

### 2. Misspelled Words
```
Reference: "Das Wetter ist schÃ¶n"
Input: "Das Weter ist schon"
Result: "Weter" and "schon" correctly marked as misspelled
```

### 3. Extra Words
```
Reference: "Die Katze schlÃ¤ft"
Input: "Die kleine Katze schlÃ¤ft gerne"
Result: "kleine" and "gerne" correctly marked as extra words
```

### 4. German Character Variants
```
Reference: "Die TÃ¼r ist grÃ¼n"
Input: "Die Tuer ist gruen"
Result: "Tuer" and "gruen" correctly recognized as equivalent to "TÃ¼r" and "grÃ¼n"
```

Need to validate the implementation using the test cases specified in the README-MERGE-OLD-W-NEW.md file:

### Example 1: Out-of-order Typing
```
Reference text: "Es gibt viel zu tun"
User input: "zu gibt Es tun"
Expected: All words except "viel" marked as correct, "viel" as missing
```

### Example 2: Misspelled Words
```
Reference text: "Das Wetter ist schÃ¶n"
User input: "Das Weter ist schon"
Expected: "Weter" marked as misspelled, "schon" marked as misspelled
```

### Example 3: Extra Words
```
Reference text: "Die Katze schlÃ¤ft"
User input: "Die kleine Katze schlÃ¤ft gerne"
Expected: "kleine" and "gerne" marked as extra words
```

## Readme Merge Old W New

# Implementation Plan: Merging Old and New Word Matching Systems

This plan outlines how to combine the proven algorithms from our old dictation matching system with the better code organization of our new modular system.

## Key Principles

1. **Use existing files** - Modify existing files instead of creating duplicates
2. **Keep what works** - Preserve the algorithms from the old system that worked perfectly
3. **Maintain modular structure** - Keep the clean organization of the new system
4. **Reference text approach** - Show only reference text with appropriate highlighting
5. **Keep hardcoded values** - Maintain the thresholds that are proven to work

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Implementation (5 days)

#### 1.1 Review Existing Files (1 day)
- Identify all relevant files in both old and new systems
- Document which algorithms need to be ported
- Map old functions to new module structure

#### 1.2 Update Text Normalization (1 day)
- Examine existing `js/modules/textComparison/textNormalizer.js`
- Replace with or merge in the German handling from the old system
- Ensure all special character transformations are preserved

#### 1.3 Update Similarity Scoring (1 day)
- Modify `js/modules/textComparison/similarityScoring.js`
- Implement the proven Levenshtein and scoring logic from old system
- Keep the hardcoded thresholds (e.g., 0.3 minimum match)

#### 1.4 Update Word Matcher (1 day)
- Modify `js/modules/textComparison/wordMatcher.js`
- Port the word alignment algorithm from the old system
- Ensure out-of-order typing works correctly

#### 1.5 Update Input Processor (1 day)
- Modify `js/modules/textComparison/inputProcessor.js`
- Integrate the main processing function from the old system
- Preserve the structure that worked with the UI manager

### Phase 2: UI Integration (5 days)

#### 2.1 Update UI Manager (2 days)
- Modify existing `js/modules/uiManager.js`
- Implement the reference-text-only display approach
- Show reference text with highlighting based on user input
- Add CSS classes for different word statuses

#### 2.2 Update Input Manager (2 days)
- Modify existing `js/modules/inputManager.js`
- Integrate with the updated comparison system
- Implement debounced input processing if not already present

#### 2.3 Update Results Screen (1 day)
- Modify existing results display
- Use the detailed statistics from the word matching system
- Keep consistent with the rest of the UI

## Test Cases from Old System

Use these examples to verify correct functionality:

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Proven reliability** - Using the algorithms that are known to work
2. **Maintainable codebase** - Preserving the clean modular structure
3. **Appropriate UI** - Showing only reference text with highlighting
4. **No duplication** - Modifying existing files instead of creating new ones
5. **Consistent experience** - Maintaining the behavior users expect

## 1. Core Architecture

The text handling system consists of several integrated components:

# German Dictation Tool - Usage Guide

## Word Matching System

The dictation tool uses an advanced word matching system designed specifically for German language learning:

### Key Features

- **Flexible Typing Order**: Words are matched regardless of the order you type them
- **German Character Handling**: Multiple ways to type umlauts and special characters
  - `ae` â†’ `Ã¤`, `oe` â†’ `Ã¶`, `ue` â†’ `Ã¼` 
  - `a:` â†’ `Ã¤`, `o:` â†’ `Ã¶`, `u:` â†’ `Ã¼`
  - `a/` â†’ `Ã¤`, `o/` â†’ `Ã¶`, `u/` â†’ `Ã¼`
  - `s:` or `s/` â†’ `ÃŸ`
- **Misspelled Word Detection**: Words with typos are highlighted but still matched to their correct position
- **Short Word Support**: All German words, including short ones (in, an, zu, etc.) are properly matched
- **Partial Word Matching**: As you type, the system shows partial matches

### Feedback Colors

- **Green**: Correctly spelled words
- **Red**: Misspelled characters or words
- **Missing letter indicators**: When a letter is missing from a word, the system shows the correct position

## Usage Tips

1. You can type words in any order - the system will match them correctly
2. For umlauts, type either the letter followed by 'e' (ae), colon (a:), or slash (a/)
3. If you're unsure about spelling, type what you hear - the system will show the correct form
4. Submit your answer when finished with the Enter key or Submit button

## Readme Enhanced Matching

# Enhanced German Word Matching

This document describes three key enhancements to the German dictation tool's word matching algorithm, designed to improve the experience for German language learners worldwide.

## New Features

### 1. Keyboard Proximity Analysis

The system analyzes input considering multiple keyboard layouts to accommodate learners using different keyboard configurations:

- **Multiple Layout Support**: 
  - **QWERTZ** (German Standard Layout)
  - **QWERTY** (US/International Layout)
  - **AZERTY** (French Layout)

- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects the most likely keyboard layout based on typo patterns
- **Adjacent Key Detection**: Recognizes when users hit neighboring keys (e.g., typing 'f' instead of 'g')
- **Reduced Penalty**: Typos involving adjacent keys receive a lower penalty (0.8 instead of 1.0), improving match quality

#### Layout-Specific Examples

```
QWERTZ LAYOUT:
"schreiben" mistyped as "schreinen" (n is adjacent to b)
"UniversitÃ¤t" mistyped as "UniversirÃ¤t" (r is adjacent to t)

QWERTY LAYOUT:
"schreiben" mistyped as "schreiven" (v is adjacent to b)
"UniversitÃ¤t" mistyped as "UniversirÃ¤y" (y is adjacent to t)

AZERTY LAYOUT:
"schreiben" mistyped as "schrei en" (space is adjacent to b)
"quizzen" mistyped as "auizzen" (a is adjacent to q)
```

### 2. Length-Based Threshold Adjustments

The system now applies different similarity thresholds based on word length:

- **More Lenient for Longer Words**: Longer words receive lower thresholds since more characters mean more opportunities for typos
- **Dynamic Formula**: `threshold = baseThreshold - (wordLength * 0.01)`, with minimum and maximum caps
- **Configurable**: Adjustment factors can be modified in `config.js`

```javascript
// Example: 
// Short word (3-4 chars): Uses standard threshold (0.3)
// Medium word (5-10 chars): Gradually more lenient
// Long word (>10 chars): Can use threshold as low as 0.2
```

### 3. German-Specific Typo Pattern Detection

The system recognizes common German-specific typing patterns:

- **"sch" written as "sh"**: A common shorthand/typo with German words
- **Umlauts written as base vowels**: Recognition of 'a' for 'Ã¤', 'o' for 'Ã¶', etc.
- **"ÃŸ" written as "s" or "ss"**: Common substitutions for the sharp S
- **Double vowel omissions**: Missing one of double vowels (e.g., 'ee', 'aa')

```javascript
// Example: typing "Strasse" instead of "StraÃŸe"
// Will receive a similarity bonus of up to 0.15
```

## Implementation Details

The enhancements are implemented across the following files:

- `keyboardProximity.js`: Contains the QWERTZ keyboard map and proximity functions
- `similarityScoring.js`: Enhanced with proximity-aware Levenshtein distance and length-based thresholds
- `wordMatcher.js`: Updated to use dynamic thresholds based on word length
- `config.js`: Added new configuration options to enable/disable features

## Testing

A dedicated test page is available to showcase these features:

## Readme Debug Logging

# Debug Logging Strategy for Dictation Tool

## Enhanced Logging Implementation

As part of our ongoing development, we've implemented a comprehensive debug logging strategy throughout the codebase. This document outlines the approach and best practices.

### Logging Principles

1. **Thorough Event Logging**: All significant events (segment changes, audio playback, user interactions) are logged with relevant contextual information.

2. **Nested Error Handling**: We use nested try/catch blocks to ensure robust error handling even in restricted environments:

```javascript
try {
    // Main function logic
} catch (error) {
    try { 
        console.error("Descriptive error message:", error);
    } catch (e) { 
        /* Silence console errors in restricted environments */ 
    }
}
```

3. **Contextual Information**: All logs include relevant context (segment numbers, current state, etc.) to aid in troubleshooting:

```javascript
console.log(`Segment ${currentSegment.index + 1} of ${totalSegments}, isLast: ${currentSegment.isLast}`);
```

4. **Critical Path Validation**: Key checkpoints in the application flow include validation logs:

```javascript
console.log('Last segment completed, showing results screen');
console.log('Input submitted for segment ' + segmentIndex);
```

### Implementation Locations

- **Audio Events**: Playback start/end and seeking operations
- **Segment Navigation**: Tracking segment changes and boundary detection
- **Input Processing**: Capturing user input and transformation results
- **Event Dispatching**: Logging when critical events are fired
- **Error States**: Detailed error message capture for debugging

### Benefits

1. Easier troubleshooting of timing and race condition issues
2. Better visibility into the application flow
3. Simplified debugging in production environments
4. Clear tracking of user paths through the application

## Using the Debug Logs

When troubleshooting issues:

1. Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Look for logs showing the sequence of events
3. Check for any error messages or warnings
4. Validate that expected events are firing in the correct order

For production deployment, these logs can be conditionally disabled with a config setting if needed.

## Readme Advanced Comparison

# Advanced Word Matching System

This module provides sophisticated text comparison functionality for the dictation tool, focusing on handling German language features, out-of-order word typing, misspellings, missing words, and extra words.

## Key Features

- **Word-level comparison** rather than character-level
- **Out-of-order word matching** - Words are matched regardless of their position in the sentence
- **Sophisticated misspelling detection** using Levenshtein distance
- **Special handling for German characters** (umlauts, ÃŸ)
- **Visual feedback** for different types of errors (misspelled, missing, extra words)
- **Detailed statistics** on a user's performance

## Components

### 1. Text Normalizer
- `textNormalizer.js` - Functions for normalizing text input with special attention to German characters
  - `normalizeText(text)` - Normalizes a full text string
  - `normalizeWord(word)` - Normalizes a single word for comparison

### 2. Similarity Scoring
- `similarityScoring.js` - Functions for calculating similarity between words
  - `calculateSimilarityScore(expected, actual)` - Calculates a similarity score between 0-1
  - `levenshteinDistance(str1, str2)` - Calculates edit distance between strings

### 3. Word Matcher
- `wordMatcher.js` - Core algorithm for aligning words
  - `findBestWordMatches(expectedWords, actualWords)` - Finds optimal alignment between expected and actual words

### 4. Input Processor
- `inputProcessor.js` - Processes input and coordinates the comparison
  - `processInput(referenceText, userInput)` - Main function to process and compare texts

## Integration Points

The system integrates with the existing application in these key areas:

1. **Input Manager** - Live feedback during typing
2. **Results Screen** - Enhanced statistics and detailed error feedback
3. **UI Manager** - Word-level highlighting and visual feedback

## Configuration

Configuration options are available in `config.js` under `textComparisonConfig`:

```javascript
export const textComparisonConfig = {
    minimumMatchThreshold: 0.3, // Minimum score to consider a match
    caseSensitive: false,       // Whether to consider case in matching
    strictPunctuation: false,   // Whether punctuation affects matching
    language: 'de'              // Default language (German)
};
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements:
- Phonetic matching for words that sound similar
- Language-specific rule configurations
- Machine learning for personalized feedback
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance

## Transformation Fix Readme



## German Special Character Transformation Fix

This update addresses an issue where the German umlaut transformations (like "ae" â†’ "Ã¤", "a:" â†’ "Ã¤") work correctly in a local server but fail when the dictation tool is embedded in Teachable via an iframe.

### Issues Fixed

1. **Iframe Sandbox Restrictions**
   - Added robust error handling to work within Teachable's sandbox restrictions
   - Implemented defensive coding to prevent JavaScript errors from breaking functionality

2. **Cursor Position Management**
   - Improved handling of cursor position after text transformation
   - Added fallbacks when `setSelectionRange()` fails in restricted environments

3. **Error-Resistant Transformation**
   - Split transformation into specialized functions with individual error handling
   - Each transformation phase can fail independently without affecting others

4. **Console Access**
   - Made all console logging optional with try-catch blocks
   - Prevents issues when console access is restricted in iframe environments

### Installation Instructions

1. Make sure the new files are in place:
   - `js/modules/inputManager.js.new`
   - `js/modules/textComparison.js.new`

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install-fix.sh
   ./install-fix.sh
   ```

3. Test the application in a Teachable iframe environment

### Testing

To verify the transformation works, enter the following text in the input field:
- "Muenchen" should transform to "MÃ¼nchen"
- "scho:n" should transform to "schÃ¶n"
- "gru/n" should transform to "grÃ¼n"
- "strasse" should transform to "straÃŸe"

### Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any errors (if accessible)
2. Verify iframe sandbox attributes include `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`
3. Restore backups from the `backups/` directory if needed

### Reverting Changes

To revert to the original files:
```bash
cp backups/YYYYMMDD/inputManager.js.bak js/modules/inputManager.js
cp backups/YYYYMMDD/textComparison.js.bak js/modules/textComparison.js
```
(Replace YYYYMMDD with the appropriate backup date folder)
