# Refactoring Plan for Dictation Tool

---

## Phase 1: Fix Immediate Errors and Add Defensive Programming

1. **Fix undefined variable issues**
    - Add proper initialization for `substringStart`: Ensure that `substringStart` is always defined before use, either by extracting it from alignment results or defaulting to 0. This prevents runtime errors and ensures correct character alignment.
    - Ensure `cleanInput` and other variables are defined before use: Always declare and initialize variables like `cleanInput`, `cleanRef`, and others before using them in comparisons or logic. This avoids reference errors and makes the code more robust.
    - Check for other places where variables might be used before definition: Audit the codebase for similar patterns and fix them proactively to prevent future bugs.
2. **Add defensive checks**
    - Add null/undefined checks for all object properties: Before accessing properties or methods on objects, verify they are not null or undefined. This prevents type errors and improves code stability.
    - Validate array indices before access: Always check that indices are within bounds before accessing array elements, especially in loops or dynamic access patterns.
3. **Implement basic error handling**
    - Add try/catch blocks around critical sections: For code that interacts with the DOM, external data, or complex logic, wrap in try/catch to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
    - Implement graceful fallbacks for failures: When an error occurs, provide user feedback or fallback logic instead of letting the app crash or behave unpredictably.
4. **Add debug logging**
    - Create logging system for alignment operations: Implement a consistent logging approach (e.g., using `console.log` or a custom logger) to trace alignment and comparison steps for easier debugging.
    - Add visual feedback for debugging alignment issues: Use UI indicators or overlays to show alignment status, mismatches, or errors during development.

## Phase 2: Improve State Management

1. **Create explicit state objects**
    - Define clear interfaces for alignment results: Use objects or TypeScript interfaces to formalize the structure of alignment results, making the code more predictable and maintainable.
    - Maintain consistent state structure: Ensure that all stateful data follows a consistent schema throughout the codebase.
2. **Add proper initialization**
    - Create initialization functions for all modules: Each module should have a clear initialization routine to set up its state and dependencies.
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped and initialized: Avoid global variables and ensure all variables are initialized in their intended scope.
3. **Implement clear data flow**
    - Document data transformation between functions: Use comments or documentation to explain how data moves and changes between functions and modules.
    - Create explicit passing of mapping data: Pass mapping and alignment data as function arguments rather than relying on shared/global state.
4. **Extract alignment logic**
    - Move alignment code to dedicated module: Refactor alignment and comparison logic into its own module (e.g., `textComparison/wordMatcher.js`).
    - Create clear API for text comparison: Expose well-documented functions for text comparison and alignment, making them reusable and testable.

## Phase 3: Split Responsibilities

1. **Extract character comparison logic**
    - Create separate service for character matching: Move character-by-character comparison logic out of UI code into a dedicated service or utility.
    - Decouple comparison from UI updates: Ensure that text comparison and UI rendering are handled in separate layers for better maintainability.
2. **Create dedicated mapping class**
    - Implement character-by-character mapping system: Build a class or module that handles mapping between input and reference characters, including special cases like umlauts.
    - Add proper error states and validation: The mapping system should handle invalid or unexpected input gracefully and provide error information.
3. **Move text transformation logic**
    - Create utility module for text transformations: Centralize all text cleaning, normalization, and transformation functions in a single utility module.
    - Standardize punctuation and case handling: Ensure all text transformations use the same rules for punctuation and case, reducing bugs and inconsistencies.
    - Consolidate similar text cleaning patterns into single utility functions: Replace repeated regex patterns with reusable functions.
4. **Create clear interfaces**
    - Define contracts between text processing and UI: Specify what data structures and formats are expected between processing and rendering layers.
    - Document expected inputs/outputs: Use comments or TypeScript to clarify function signatures and data expectations.

## Phase 4: Standardize Alignment Approaches

1. **Replace ad-hoc alignment code**
    - Implement consistent algorithm across codebase: Use a single, well-tested alignment algorithm for all text comparison tasks.
    - Remove duplicate alignment logic: Eliminate redundant or inconsistent alignment code to reduce maintenance burden.
2. **Create unified special character handling**
    - Standardize handling of digraphs and special characters: Treat cases like 'oe' → 'ö' or 'sh' → 'sch' in a consistent, configurable way.
    - Create configurable character equivalence system: Allow for easy updates to character equivalence rules as language needs evolve.
3. **Standardize transformation maps**
    - Create formal definition for transformations: Document and implement a single source of truth for character transformations.
    - Ensure consistent usage throughout the code: All modules should use the same transformation logic and data.
4. **Implement proper substring matching**
    - Create robust algorithm for partial matches: Ensure substring matches are handled accurately, including correct offset calculations.
    - Handle edge cases with proper alignment: Test and support cases like missing characters, extra punctuation, or partial word matches.

## Phase 5: Improve Error Handling and Edge Cases

1. **Add explicit error states**
    - Create visual indicators for alignment failures: Show clear UI feedback when alignment or comparison fails.
    - Add user-friendly error messages: Provide helpful messages to users when something goes wrong, rather than generic errors.
2. **Implement fallback behaviors**
    - Define graceful degradation for alignment failures: If alignment can't be performed, show a fallback UI or skip the problematic word.
    - Add recovery mechanisms for common issues: Allow users to retry or correct errors without reloading the app.
3. **Add corner case handling**
    - Support empty input, all-punctuation cases: Ensure the app doesn't break on unusual or minimal input.
    - Handle words with mixed scripts or symbols: Support multilingual input and special characters robustly.
    - Add specific tests for edge cases: Write tests for all known tricky scenarios.
4. **Add validation**
    - Validate all inputs before processing: Check that all data is in the expected format before running logic.
    - Create state transition validation: Ensure that state changes only happen in valid, predictable ways.

## Phase 6: Optimize and Clean Up

1. **Review performance bottlenecks**
    - Profile and optimize slow functions: Use profiling tools to find and fix slow code paths.
    - Improve DOM manipulation efficiency: Batch DOM updates and avoid unnecessary reflows.
2. **Remove duplicate code**
    - Create shared utilities for common operations: Centralize repeated logic in utility modules.
    - Consolidate similar functions: Merge functions that do similar things to reduce code size and complexity.
3. **Add comprehensive documentation**
    - Document all public functions and parameters: Ensure every function is clearly described for future maintainers.
    - Create architecture diagrams: Visualize the system's structure for easier onboarding and planning.
4. **Create automated tests**
    - Unit tests for core functionality: Write tests for all major logic components.
    - Integration tests for UI components: Test how modules work together, especially for user-facing features.
    - Add explicit tests for error cases and edge conditions: Ensure the app is robust against unexpected input and failures.
