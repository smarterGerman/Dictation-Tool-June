# Debug Logging Strategy for Dictation Tool

## Enhanced Logging Implementation

As part of our ongoing development, we've implemented a comprehensive debug logging strategy throughout the codebase. This document outlines the approach and best practices.

### Logging Principles

1. **Thorough Event Logging**: All significant events (segment changes, audio playback, user interactions) are logged with relevant contextual information.

2. **Nested Error Handling**: We use nested try/catch blocks to ensure robust error handling even in restricted environments:

```javascript
try {
    // Main function logic
} catch (error) {
    try { 
        console.error("Descriptive error message:", error);
    } catch (e) { 
        /* Silence console errors in restricted environments */ 
    }
}
```

3. **Contextual Information**: All logs include relevant context (segment numbers, current state, etc.) to aid in troubleshooting:

```javascript
console.log(`Segment ${currentSegment.index + 1} of ${totalSegments}, isLast: ${currentSegment.isLast}`);
```

4. **Critical Path Validation**: Key checkpoints in the application flow include validation logs:

```javascript
console.log('Last segment completed, showing results screen');
console.log('Input submitted for segment ' + segmentIndex);
```

### Implementation Locations

- **Audio Events**: Playback start/end and seeking operations
- **Segment Navigation**: Tracking segment changes and boundary detection
- **Input Processing**: Capturing user input and transformation results
- **Event Dispatching**: Logging when critical events are fired
- **Error States**: Detailed error message capture for debugging

### Benefits

1. Easier troubleshooting of timing and race condition issues
2. Better visibility into the application flow
3. Simplified debugging in production environments
4. Clear tracking of user paths through the application

## Using the Debug Logs

When troubleshooting issues:

1. Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Look for logs showing the sequence of events
3. Check for any error messages or warnings
4. Validate that expected events are firing in the correct order

For production deployment, these logs can be conditionally disabled with a config setting if needed.
